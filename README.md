If you want your own bot on telegram, you will need to make a bot using Botfather and change the 'BOT_TOKEN' on line 15 in telegram.py to the token of your bot. 
Otherwise just start running telegram.py. After sending your email address (the one your tgtg account is registered on) you will need to open the email in the browser and confirm the login. 
Now the program will run and notify you on telegram if a suprise bag is available.
